# The Horizon Platform
The Horizon Platform is a web application project developed as a demonstration by a three-man team for the completion of a React.js course. This platform is built using JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, providing a robust and scalable solution for developing modern web applications. The project is expected to be redeveloped for official purposes in the future.
